Monitoring and Alerts for App Engine Application with Terraform
================================================================

Objective
---------

To develop and implement a monitoring and alert system for an application on App Engine using Terraform.

Components
----------

Metrics
^^^^^^^

The following key metrics will be analyzed:

- CPU Usage: Monitoring the application's CPU usage to identify bottlenecks and optimize performance.
- Memory: Monitoring the application's memory usage to detect memory leaks and ensure resource use efficiency.
- Latency: Measuring the application's response time to evaluate user experience and processing speed.
- Traffic: Monitoring the volume of requests and traffic the application receives to identify demand spikes and efficiently scale resources.
- Errors: Tracking the frequency and type of errors occurring in the application to detect issues and improve stability.

Data Collection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Stackdriver Monitoring will be used to collect the application's metrics on App Engine.
- Terraform will be used to automate the configuration and management of Stackdriver Monitoring resources.

Alert Policy Creation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Custom alert policies will be created for each metric, defining thresholds and conditions that trigger notifications when anomalies are detected.
- Alert policies will be configured to send notifications to a specific Slack channel, allowing relevant teams to receive timely information on critical events.

Automation with Terraform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Terraform scripts will be used to automate the creation and configuration of:
  - Metrics in Stackdriver Monitoring.
  - Alert policies.
  - Integration with the Slack channel.

Benefits
--------

- Complete Visibility: Comprehensive monitoring of the application's status and performance.
- Early Problem Detection: Proactive identification of anomalies and errors before they affect users.
- Quick Response: Automatic notification to relevant teams for a quick resolution of issues.
- Operational Efficiency: Automation of monitoring and alert management.

Additional Considerations
-------------------------

- Scalability: The monitoring and alert system must be scalable to accommodate the application's growth and traffic.
- Security: Security measures must be implemented to protect the application's data and resources.
- Customization: Metrics, alert policies, and notification channels should be configurable according to the specific needs of the project.
