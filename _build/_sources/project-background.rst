Project Background
==================

The RESTful API prototype developed in this project supports product data and user reviews management. This includes designing cloud infrastructure using Terraform, developing the API with Python, and ensuring the system is secure, highly available, and compliant with best security practices.

Additionally, this project includes developing a monitoring and alert system for an application on App Engine. This system is focused on analyzing key performance metrics, using Stackdriver for data collection, and Terraform for automating resource management, aimed at ensuring the application's efficient and secure operation while being scalable to accommodate growth.
