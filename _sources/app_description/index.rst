Objective
---------

To develop and implement a monitoring and alert system for an application on App Engine using Terraform.

Components
----------
The system comprises several components, each responsible for a specific aspect of monitoring and alerts. Detailed documentation on each of these components can be found on the :ref:`components_page`.

- :ref:`Metrics <metrics_section>`
- :ref:`Data Collection <data_collection_section>`
- :ref:`Alert Policy Creation <alert_policy_creation_section>`
- :ref:`Automation with Terraform <automation_with_terraform_section>`

Benefits
--------

- Complete Visibility: Comprehensive monitoring of the application's status and performance.
- Early Problem Detection: Proactive identification of anomalies and errors before they affect users.
- Quick Response: Automatic notification to relevant teams for a quick resolution of issues.
- Operational Efficiency: Automation of monitoring and alert management.

Additional Considerations
-------------------------

- Scalability: The monitoring and alert system must be scalable to accommodate the application's growth and traffic.
- Security: Security measures must be implemented to protect the application's data and resources.
- Customization: Metrics, alert policies, and notification channels should be configurable according to the specific needs of the project.
