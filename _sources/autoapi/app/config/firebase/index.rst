   Firestore Database Client Initialization
   ========================================

   This module establishes a connection to a Firestore database using the Google Cloud Firestore client. It is designed to facilitate interactions with Firestore, enabling the application to perform operations such as reading, writing, and querying documents within a Firestore database.

   Requirements:
       - Google Cloud Firestore library: This module relies on the `google-cloud-firestore` package for the Firestore client. Ensure this package is installed in your environment.
       - Authentication: The Google Cloud Firestore client requires proper authentication to access and interact with your Firestore database. Authentication can be configured through environment variables specifying the path to your Google Cloud service account key file.

   Usage:
       - The `db` variable is a Firestore client instance, ready to be used throughout the application for database operations.
       - This client handles tasks such as connecting to the database, performing CRUD operations, and managing transactions.

   .. rubric:: Example

   To use this Firestore client for reading a document from a collection named 'users', you can do the following:

   ```python
   user_ref = db.collection('users').document('user_id')
   user_doc = user_ref.get()
   if user_doc.exists:
       print(user_doc.to_dict())
   else:
       print('No such document!')

   This module simplifies the process of integrating Firestore database operations into your application by providing a pre-configured Firestore client.
